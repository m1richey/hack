      <h3 id="intro">So you’ve decided to attend your first hackathon- Congratulations! Before you go, here are some commonly asked questions to get you started.</h3>
      <div class ="question">
      <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
      <p> So what is a hackathon, anyway? A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers, graphic designers, and other tech-minded people come together to create a product in a short amount of time. Typical hackathons last about 24 hours, although some can span several days.</p>
      </div>

      <div class ="question">
      <h4>How do I know what to expect at my hackathon?</h4>
      <p>Hackathons can have different formats, themes, and lengths. Before you go, take a look at the webpage of your specific hackathon. There, you’ll find information about what tools to bring, what will be provided, and how long to expect to stay. </p>
      <p>Next, visit our <a href="whattoexpect.html">What to Expect page</a> for an in-depth look at how hackathons typically work. </p>
      <p>Finally, take a look  at the video on our homepage, which gives you a quick overview of how teams typically interact during a hackathon.</p>

      <div class="clear"></div>
      <div class ="question">
      <h4>Do I need any skills before I arrive?</h4>
      <p>Most hackathons assume that the participants have at least a basic knowledge in computer programming and/or graphical design. This doesn’t mean you need to know how to code, though - problem-solving skills, artistic skills, and communication skills all come in handy!</p>
      <p>Look at your hackathon’s website to determine if there is a theme or any background knowledge participants are required to know. For example, if the theme of your hackathon is “Homelessness”, read up on some common problems facing the homeless community and how new technologies or programs could help these problems. </p>
      <p>If your hackathon requires that you know some basic coding, visit our <a href="resources.html">Resources page</a> for some beginners tutorials on basic computer languages. </p>
      </div>

      <div class ="question">
      <h4>What tools should I have before I arrive?</h4>
      <p>If you’re going to be working with code, make sure you have a basic version control system set up on your computer. Visit our <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials page</a> for an explanation of version control and how to set up a basic version control system on your computer. </p>
      <p>If you think you might be making a website, you’ll also want to have Google App Engine set up on your computer. Visit our <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials page</a> to learn about Google App Engine and how to get it started on your computer. </p>
      <p>You’ll find these and other great tutorials for useful tools on our <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials page.</a> </p>
