        <p style="text-align: center;">A typical hackathon will last approximately 24 hours. Participants will work in teams, and there will be a goal or prize at the end of the event. Let's get started!</p>

		<h4>What to Bring</h4>
		<p> Before arriving, research your specific hackathon to see what will be provided. Typical items that will be provided are:
		<ul>
			<li>Snacks and/or meals</li>
			<li>Charging stations</li>
			<li>Basic office materials (paper, pencils, whiteboards)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Items that you should bring are:
		<ul>
			<li>Computer and charger</li>
			<li>Sleeping bag and/or air mattress</li>
			<li>Change of clothes</li>
			<li>Toiletries</li>
			<li>Water bottle</li>
			<li>Personal identification</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Arriving</h4>
		<p>Arrive early to your event. Be prepared to show identification for the registration process. Once you have registered, you can find a space to work in the hackathon venue. Ensure that your space has:
		<ul>
			<li>Adequate lighting</li>
			<li>Close charging stations</li>
			<li>Seating</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
	
	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Getting Started</h4>
		<p>The day will typically start with a presentation on the topic and rules of the hackathon. Make sure to:
		<ul>
			<li>Take note of all important rules</li>
			<li>Make a list of skills you have that might be helpful</li>
			<li>Write down any questions that come up during the presentation</li>
			<li>Write down any initial ideas that come up</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Finding a Team</h4>
		<p>You can arrive at a hackathon either with a pre-formed team or as an individual- both are welcome! After the presentation concludes, individuals will be given time to form teams. When forming a team:
		<ul>
			<li>Find other individuals with similar interests or skills to you</li>
			<li>Find other individuals with similar experience or education level. This will make it easier to decide on a project to which you can all contribute.</li>
			<li>Find other indviduals with similar goals. If your goal is to learn about hackathons, don't join a fast-paced team that is there to win at all costs. Similarly, if you're excited about a prize, don't join a team that is there for the learning experience</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
	
	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Start Brainstorming</h4>
		<p>Once the presentation is over and teams are formed, participants are free to begin working on the project. Although it may be tempting to dive right into coding, start by:
		<ul>
			<li>Asking each group member for an initial idea</li>
			<li>Write down all ideas that come up</li>
			<li>Identify possible constraints with each idea</li>
			<li>Identify how each idea could contribute to the overall goal</li>
			<li>Identify specific skills needed for each idea</li>
			<li>Decide on a final idea based on constraints and group skills</li>
			<li>Assign tasks to each team member</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>During the Hackathon</h4>
		<p> Once you have decided on a final idea and have assigned tasks, you can begin working. While working, make sure to:
		<ul>
			<li>Take frequent breaks! Stretch at least once an hour, and take snack breaks throughout the day.</li>
			<li>Check in with progress updates of each team member's work. It is recommended to check in before breaking for meals as well as before a team member goes to bed.</li>
			<li>Ask for help when needed! Teams that are at a hackathon to learn will often be willing to help other teams. Collaborate when possible to learn new skills.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Make sure to get enough sleep and food during the hackathon. Most participants will bring sleeping bags and sleep when they have time. Before starting:
		<ul>
			<li>Tell your team members what your expectations are and when you would like to sleep and eat meals.</li>
			<li>Get to a good stopping point in your work before taking a break so that you don't forget what you were doing</li>
			<li>Take notes if necessary to remind yourself of your progress and goals.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="clear"></div>

	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Finishing the Hackathon</h4>
		<p>When you are nearing the end of the hackathon, an announcer will announce how much time is left. Finish your work, and don't worry if you didn't arrive at a completed project- most hackathons are about what you learned and not what you accomplished.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="question" style="text-align: left;">
		<h4>Demos</h4>
		<p>At the end of the hackathon, each team will be given the opportunity to demo their project or skills they learned. Refer to the website of your specific hackathon to determine whether you should present slides or simply a demo. In your demo, make sure to:
		<ul>
			<li>Show the main functionality of what you created.</li>
			<li>Highlight the skills you learned.</li>
			<li>Tell what went wrong and how you dealt with it.</li>
			<li>If you don't have a working demo, present your idea and the impact you envision the finished project having.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Prizes and Leaving</h4>
	<p>After all teams have presented their demos, the judges will award prizes. After the prizes are awarded:
	<ul>
		<li>Clean up your area.</li>
		<li>Ensure you have all materials you came with.</li>
		<li>Thank your team members for a great time!</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	
	<p>Congratulations! You have just completed your first hackathon!</p>
